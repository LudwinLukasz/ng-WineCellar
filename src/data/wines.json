        "description": "Wine descriptions are terms used to describe wine when wine tasting. Because wines can be quite complex and exhibit many various types of characteristics, tasters use a lot of unique terms to describe what they are smelling, tasting or feeling. Some of these can get pretty advanced, using descriptors that are not familiar to the average person. In order to fully understand wine tasting notes (such as in wine tasting magazines or reviews) and also to broaden your wine vocabulary and ability to communicate with others about wine, we have here definitions of some common wine terms that are used to describe wines. We have more basic Wine Tasting Terms listed elsewhere as well.",
